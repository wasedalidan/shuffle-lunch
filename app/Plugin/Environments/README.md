# Environments Plugin

A plugin to handle environment-level configuration

## Requirements

* CakePHP 2.x

## Installation

_[Using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)]_

[View on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/josegonzalez/cakephp-environments), and copy the json snippet for the latest version into your project's `composer.json`. Eg, v. 1.0.0 would look like this:

```javascript
{
	"require": {
		"josegonzalez/cakephp-environments": "1.0.0"
	}
}
```

Because this plugin has the type `cakephp-plugin` set in it's own `composer.json`, composer knows to install it inside your `/Plugins` directory, rather than in the usual vendors file. It is recommended that you add `/Plugins/Environments` to your .gitignore file. (Why? [read this](http://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).)

_[Manual]_

* Download this: [https://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-environments/zipball/master](https://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-environments/zipball/master)
* Unzip that download.
* Copy the resulting folder to `app/Plugin`
* Rename the folder you just copied to `Environments`

_[GIT Submodule]_

In your app directory type:

	git submodule add git://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-environments.git Plugin/Environments
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

_[GIT Clone]_

In your plugin directory type

	git clone git://github.com/josegonzalez/cakephp-environments.git Environments

### Enable plugin

Before using, you MUST enable the plugin:

	CakePlugin::load('Environments');

If you are already using `CakePlugin::loadAll();` before usage, then this is not necessary.

## Usage

Setup a directory structure as follows:

	app/Config/bootstrap/environments.php
	app/Config/bootstrap/environments/production.php
	app/Config/bootstrap/environments/staging.php
	app/Config/bootstrap/environments/development.php

We specify multiple **environment** files to separate the various configurations and make it easy to inspect a given environment. This is not necessary, but useful if you are configuring a large amount of information.

Your `environments.php` should contain the following:

	<?php
	CakePlugin::load('Environments');
	App::uses('Environment', 'Environments.Lib');

	include dirname(__FILE__) . DS . 'environments' . DS . 'production.php';
	include dirname(__FILE__) . DS . 'environments' . DS . 'staging.php';
	include dirname(__FILE__) . DS . 'environments' . DS . 'development.php';

	Environment::start();

This will:

- Load the environments plugin in cases where it may not already be loaded
- Include every environment, in order of specificity (development is usually last)
- Start the environment

### Environment Configuration

Each environment may be configured as follows:

	Environment::configure($name, $params, $config = null, $callable = null);

Example usage of the `Environment::configure()` call is available in the `Config/bootstrap/environments` folder of this plugin.

- `$name`: Usually something like `production` or `development`. Good practice is to name it the same as the file it was in, so that there isn't any confusion as to what a given env file contains
- `$params`: An array or boolean of environment variables used to check whether this environment applies. If a boolean and set to true, this environment is automatically initiated. A value of `true` should only be used for development:

		# If a previous environment is not enabled, this one will be set
		Environment::configure('development', true, array('debug' => true));

	If an array, the **keys** may be function names that are called, with the **values** being passed to it:

		Environment::configure('development', true, array(
			'some_function' => 'aValueForThisCheck',
			'another_function' => 'aDifferentValueForThisCheck',
		));

	In all other cases, we simply check the environment:

		Environment::configure('octo_development', true, array(
			'SERVER_NAME' => 'octo-example.dev',
		));

		Environment::configure('bear_development', true, array(
			'SERVER_NAME' => 'bear-example.dev',
		));

		Environment::configure('development', true, array(
			'CAKE_ENV' => 'development',
		));

	If we are running in CLI, the only check enforced is `CAKE_ENV`, and the value MUST be the name of the environment:

		CAKE_ENV=production Console/cake bake all

	If the `CAKE_ENV` environment variable is set at all, it takes precedence over everything, including a boolean value for `$params`.
- `$config`: If set, an array of `keys` => `values` that are set via `Configure::write()`. Useful for batch-setting api keys, database connection information, etc.
- `$callable`: A PHP callable, such as `array('ClassName', 'functionName')`. In PHP53+, it is also possible to use an anonymous function. This is the preferred method of setting information that might depend upon the value of some function call.

### Database Switching

You may wish to set database connection information based upon the current environment. The following is the preferred method:

	<?php
	class DATABASE_CONFIG {

		public $default;

		public function __construct() {
			$this->default = array(
				'datasource' => 'Database/Mysql',
				'persistent' => false,
				'host' => $this->read('MYSQL_DB_HOST'),
				'login' => $this->read('MYSQL_USERNAME'),
				'password' => $this->read('MYSQL_PASSWORD'),
				'database' => $this->read('MYSQL_DB_NAME'),
				'prefix' => $this->read('MYSQL_PREFIX'),
				'encoding' => 'utf8',
			);
		}

		public function read($key, $default = null) {
			$value = env($key);
			if ($value !== null) {
				return $value;
			}

			$value = Configure::read($key);
			if ($value !== null) {
				return $value;
			}

			return $default;
		}
	}

This way, the only place necessary to view connection information is in your configured environment. It is also possible to set the connection information via a `CLI` wrapper, `nginx` or `apache` configuration, or even in your cloud provider's env settings, such as Heroku or PHPFog.
